/**
 * Relocation for a MIPS J-type instruction.
 *
 * The J-type instructions for MIPS encode a jump that is relative to the start of the 256 MiB block that the program
 * counter is in (i.e. it takes the upper 4 bits from the current PC and the next 26 bits from the immediate). It's an
 * hybrid between an absolute and relative jump and therefore require its own relocation type for proper modelization.
